# FurnitureEngine
FurnitureEngine allows you to easily make and fully customize simple furniture (such as chairs and tables) for your server.

The plugin uses item frames and resource packs instead of armor stands, for a lag free experience. 

I have also offered some **Default Furniture** and a **Default Resource Pack** that you can use on your server at any time without attribution.
